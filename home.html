<p>Quantum technology is a class of technology that works by using the principles of quantum 
mechanics (the physics of sub-atomic particles), including quantum entanglement and quantum 
superposition.</p>
<p>Such a definition might make your head spin, but the truth is, you don’t need to know exactly 
what quantum technology is to make use of it. Your smartphone is a type of quantum technology – its
semiconductors use quantum physics to work – but neither you or the engineer who designed it need to know the ins and outs of quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>The reason we’re talking about quantum technology now, 50 years after it became a part of our
 lives through nuclear power, is that the latest feats of engineering are harnessing more of the
 potential of quantum mechanics. We’re now starting to control quantum entanglement and quantum
 superposition. That means quantum technology promises improvements to a vast range of everyday 
gadgets, including:</p>
<p>
->more reliable navigation and timing systems (check out our work to create the world's smallest quantum navigation device).<br>
->more secure communications<br>
->more accurate healthcare imaging<br>
->more powerful computing.</p>
<p>
All these applications could, to some extent, be useful within a year or two. But it’s hard to know 
which will be a simple evolution and which will be truly disruptive. That uncertainty gives proactive
 businesses an opportunity as the difference between evolution and revolution will likely be early 
investment.</p>
