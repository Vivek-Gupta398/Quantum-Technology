<h2>Riken Wires A New Path To Scalable Quantum Computing</h2>

<p>Yasunobu Nakamura, Team Leader, Superconducting Quantum Electronics Research Team has 
written this extensive explanation as to why he believes a new circuit-wiring scheme 
developed over the last three years by RIKEN, in collaboration with other institutes, opens
the door to scaling up to 100 or more qubits within the next decade.<br> 


<h3>Challenge one: Scalability</h3> 
The challenge of scalability arises from the fact that each qubit then needs wiring and 
connections that produce controls and readouts with minimal crosstalk. As we moved past 
tiny two-by-two or four-by-four arrays of qubits, we have realized just how densely the 
associated wiring can be packed, and we’ve had to create better systems and fabrication
 methods to avoid getting our wires crossed, literally. 


<h3>Challenge two: Stability</h3> 
In theory, one way we could deal with instability is to use quantum error correction, 
where we exploit several physical qubits to encode a single ‘logical qubit’, and apply
an error correction protocol that can diagnose and fix errors to protect the logical qubit.
But realizing this is still far off for many reasons, not the least of which is the 
problem of scalability. 


<h3>Challenge Three: Quantum Circuits</h3> 
We at Riken eventually came up with the idea of using a superconducting circuit.  
The superconducting state is free of all electrical resistance and losses, and so it is
streamlined to respond to small quantum-mechanical effects.<br>

<h4>Hybrid Systems:</h4> 
We use our superconducting quantum-circuit platform in combination with other
quantum-mechanical systems. This hybrid quantum system allows us to measure a single 
quantum reaction within collective excitations-be it precessions of electron spins 
in a magnet, crystal lattice vibrations in a substrate, or electromagnetic fields in 
a circuit-with unprecedented sensitivity.<br>
<h4>Quantum internet</h4> 
Interfacing a superconducting quantum computer to an optical quantum communication network 
is another future challenge for our hybrid system.</p><br>

<h2>Fermilab Scientists Publish Quantum Computing Course For High School Students</h2>

<p>Fermilab regularly makes fundamental science discoveries and is a world leader in 
quantum physics. In 2019, it launched the Fermilab Quantum Institute, which conducts 
world-class research at the leading edge of quantum computing and information science, 
laying the groundwork for critical physics calculations to be performed on quantum computers.
As such, Fermilab is an ideal place to bring together particle physics and quantum 
computing as two complementary fields.<br>
The Fermilab group developed a course, “Quantum Computing as a High School Module,” which 
is available on the open-access archive arXiv. The course is the first on quantum computing
designed for U.S. high school students, but it is also useful for a quantum-computing-curious 
public. <br>
The teachers ensured that the material is at the appropriate level, and we ensured that the 
science is sound.
We created the course to guide students through various aspects of quantum computing without
relying on prior knowledge of quantum mechanics. Conceptual ideas are reinforced with 
active learning techniques, such as interactive problem sets and simulation-based labs at 
various levels. We’ve heard that the walkthrough exercises that use IBM’s real quantum 
computer to build a Schroedinger’s worm (equivalent to the cat) have been a real hit.</p><br><br>

<h2>Portugal Joins EU’s Quantum Communication Infrastructure Initiative</h2>

<p>Portugal has joined EU’s Quantum Communication Infrastructure initiative (“EuroQCI”).
 The initiative trusts on developing a network over the next ten years for sensitive 
information to be shared. As with anything that may be ill-used, quantum computing poses 
a serious cyberthreat. EuroQCI will use quantum technologies to ensure the secure transfer
and storage of sensitive information. As computer parts are now as small as the size of an
atom and current computing is reaching its physical limits, the EuroQCI aims at making 
quantum computing and cryptography a part of conventional communication networks, which is
in line with Portugal’s strategy to strengthen the country’s digital ecosystem.<br>
Objective number one of Portugal’s National Cybersecurity Strategy is to ensure national 
digital resilience by leveraging inclusion and cooperation in order to bolster the security
of cyberspace in view of threats which may jeopardize or cause disruption of networks and 
information systems essential to society. Currently, the EU’s Study on the System 
Architecture of a Quantum Communication Infrastructure (within the EuroQCI initiative) is 
open for contributions on the future of quantum network infrastructures. The consultation 
is open until 10 June 2020.</p>
